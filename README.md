# CMPT 300 - Operating Systems I

In this course, I gained a deep understanding of modern operating systems, focusing on their core services and fundamental principles. The course covered various essential topics, including multiprogramming, process management, memory management, and file systems. 

The repository contains my implementations of four assignments that allowed me to apply and deepen my knowledge of these concepts:

1. **Property Lists Implementation**: Through this assignment, I learned to manage and work with property lists, enhancing my understanding of data structures and their applications in operating systems.

2. **Sockets and Network Programming**: By implementing a multithreaded sender-receiver protocol with blocking, I gained practical experience in network communication and socket programming.

3. **Custom Memory Allocation**: This assignment involved creating an implementation of `malloc` and `free` in C, where I explored the trade-offs between runtime efficiency and space complexity using hashmaps and arrays.

4. **Disk Scheduling Algorithms**: I implemented and compared the Shortest Seek Time First (SSTF) and SCAN disk scheduling algorithms, learning to evaluate their performance based on delay and the number of disk tracks accessed.

These assignments reflect the key principles and skills I developed throughout the course, providing practical insights into operating system design and functionality.
